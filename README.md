## 📌 Problem Statement  
Urban cities in India face **severe traffic congestion**, leading to:  
- Long commute times ⏳  
- Increased CO₂ emissions 🌍  
- Delayed emergency services 🚑  
- Reduced logistics and workforce productivity 📦  

A **smart, AI-driven traffic management solution** is required to optimize urban mobility, reduce congestion, and enable faster emergency response.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
We built an **AI-powered modular platform** for **real-time traffic optimization**, integrating **computer vision, reinforcement learning, and citizen participation**.  

### 🔑 Key Features  
- **🚗 Lane-wise Vehicle Counting & Incident Detection** using **YOLOv11 + BoT-SORT**  
- **🧠 Agentic AI** dynamically adjusting signal timings in real-time  
- **⏱ 1-Hour Traffic Forecasting** using Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning + RL models)  
- **🌐 3D Simulation Preview** for planners with **three.js**  
- **📊 Live Dashboard (SUMO)** – Graphs, alerts, and predictive analytics  
- **🚌 Bus Route Optimization** – Adaptive routing based on passenger demand  
- **🚨 Emergency Green Corridors** – Automatic signal clearance for ambulances/fire trucks  
- **📱 Citizen Reports + Targeted Alerts** via mobile/web apps

## 🗺️ Live 2D Traffic Monitoring Map (Nashik)
We have integrated a real-time, interactive **2D Traffic Monitoring Map** powered by Leaflet. This dashboard feature provides a bird's-eye view of traffic density across 80 active camera feeds in the Nashik area.

- **Dynamic Markers:** Custom UI box indicators visualizing live vehicle counts for Cars (🚗), Bikes (🏍️), and Buses (🚌).
- **Camera Selection Dropdown:** Instantly search and fly to any of the 80 camera locations across the city.
- **Live State Updates:** View real-time simulated traffic density and active congestion alerts natively on the map.
